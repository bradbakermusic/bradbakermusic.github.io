# Grant Green Words Analysis

Grant Green is one of my favorite jazz musicians and I want to understand more about how he plays. In this analysis I'm pulling out some of the language he uses most frequently to understand the some of the building blocks of his playing. In that sense, these are some of the "words" he uses most frequently and that feel unique to him. By utilizing these one can better get the Grant Green thing going on.

## Mario

The first concept that Green employs that feels unique to his conception of guitar playing I call "Mario." He will hammer on or sweep into a note which he will then sustain. The grace note leading into the sustained note sounds like Mario jumping and hitting a coin block is why I call it Mario. He employs this technique on many of his solos that I've analyzed. 

An example is in his solo on Just Friends from his First Recording album at 1:52 where he hammers on to Eb from C. He does it twice in a row.

There are countless examples in Green's playing of this technique and listening will show how often he uses it and how effective it is. 

A variant of this technique is where Green will follow Mario up with a rake down an octave from the note he Mario'd into. He will usually go down the minor triad to the same note like this example from his solo on Green Dolphin Street from Gooden's Corner at 1:18

## Diminished Arpeggios

One of Grant Green's favorite techniques for creating compelling lines and leading to strong resolutions is to outline diminished chords over dominiants that resolve. He'll use this over any V-I or V-i type progression. There is one lick family in particular that he goes back to time and again. The bare bones version of the lick is a triplet pattern going starting on the major third of the dominant, going up to the 5th, and flat 7th, then descending from the flat 9, root, flat seventh, and then resolving to the third of the tonic. Here is an example from his solo on Alone Together from the Green Street Recording.
