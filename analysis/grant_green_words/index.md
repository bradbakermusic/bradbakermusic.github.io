Preamble about Green's playing

## Mario

The first concept that Green employs that feels unique to his conception of guitar playing I call "Mario." He will hammer on or sweep to a note which he will then sustain. The grace note leading into the sustained note sounds like Mario jumping and hitting a coin block is why I call it Mario. He employs this technique on many of his solos that I've analyzed.  

An example is in his solo on Just Friends from his First Recording album at 1:52 where he hammers on to Eb (1st string, 11th fret) from C (1st string, 8th fret). He does it twice in a row.

There are countless examples in Green's playing of this technique and listening will show how often he uses it and how effective it is. 

A variant of this technique is where Green will follow Mario up with a rake down an octave from the note he Mario'd into. He will usually go down the minor triad to the same note like this example from his solo on Green Dolphin Street from Gooden's Corner at 1:18
